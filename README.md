GitPushy Simple Deployment System
========

Historically code deployment has been a mess. It is either handled by a Merge Master who inadvertently forgets a step and causes the whole system to go down or it is handed by a Continuous Integration System wich takes a degree in quanotum physics to understand and configure.

FRINKnet thinks deployments should be simple. Access controls to a git repository should determin who has access. Deployment should be as simple as commiting to a certain brance of the git repository. Deployment scripts are almost always writen in bash anyway so why not write the entire deployment engine in this wonderful scripting language?
